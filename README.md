# php-barcode-Docker

An absolute test. Running php code to generate a barcode using docker to host apache php. I am just going to put together elements to get an example up and running. To do so I am following a [guide from sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/) on the topic of setting up a development environment for nginx/php/ application.
